# 3D Dice Roller

This is a 3D dice roller application built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. It allows users to interact with various types of dice (D20, D6, D4) in a 3D environment. The dice can be rolled by clicking on them, and they will bounce and roll realistically based on physics simulations.

## Features

- Interactive 3D dice rolling simulation
- Support for different types of dice: D20, D6, D4
- Realistic physics using the Rapier physics engine
- Texture selector to change the appearance of the dice
- Camera follows the dice as they roll
- Automatic reset of dice position when they fall off the platform

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- React Three Drei
- Rapier physics engine
- Zustand for state management
